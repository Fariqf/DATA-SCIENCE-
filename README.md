waiter tips prediction
Tipping waiters for serving food depends on various factors such as the type of restaurant, the number of people you are with, the total bill amount, and more. Predicting the tips given to a waiter in a restaurant is a popular task in data science

columns:
total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes
tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars
sex: gender of the person paying the bill
smoker: whether the person smoked or not
day: day of the week time: lunch or dinner 
size: number of people in a table

The restaurant has recorded data related to waiter tips, and our task is to analyze the data to identify the factors that affect the tips received by waiters. Additionally, we aim to train a machine learning model that can predict the amount of tips a waiter is likely to receive. By examining the recorded data, we can uncover the significant factors that contribute to the tipping patterns in the restaurant, enabling us to build an effective predictive model.
